description: "Transparent breakdown of David's minimal fee system and unstaking process."
---

David operates on a simple and transparent fee structure, charging only 0.1% when unstaking from protocols. All other operations, including staking, and strategy execution, are completely free with zero gas fees.

Unstaking process explained:

* 0.1% fee applies only during unstaking operations

* Best prices aggregated across DEXs for token swaps

* Automated routing for optimal conversion rates

* No L2 native unstaking fees (as direct unstaking isn't supported yet)

* Zero gas fees for all transactions

* No hidden charges or subscription fees

Note: DEX swaps are necessary during unstaking as current staking/restaking protocols don't support direct L2 native token unstaking. David aggregates prices across multiple DEXs to ensure you get the best possible rates.
