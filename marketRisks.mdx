title: "Market Risks"
description: "Understanding potential risks associated with DeFi staking and protocols."

While David prioritizes security and reliability, users should be aware of inherent DeFi risks. Your capital can be subject to smart contract risks, market volatility, and protocol-specific challenges despite our careful vetting process.

Key risks to consider:

* Smart contract vulnerabilities in underlying protocols

* Market volatility affecting token values

* Temporary loss of liquidity during peak network congestion

* Potential delays in unstaking from protocols

* DEX slippage during token conversions

Note: David mitigates these risks through protocol vetting, secure architecture, and best execution practices, but cannot eliminate them entirely.
