David utilizes a robust smart account architecture with a dual-permission model that ensures maximum security while enabling automated operations. The architecture distinguishes between two types of actors: Admins (you) and Session Keys (David), each with clearly defined permissions and limitations.

Admin Rights (Your Control):

* Full and unrestricted access to your account

* Exclusive withdrawal rights

* Ability to add or remove session keys

* Complete control over native token balance

* Can bypass ERC-4337 infrastructure if needed

Session Keys (David's Access):

* Limited permissions set by admin

* Restricted to specific approved protocols

* Time-bound access window

* Must use ERC-4337 infrastructure

* Configurable transaction value limits

* No withdrawal rights

This architecture ensures that while David can execute strategies on your behalf, you maintain full custody and control of your funds at all times.
